# BIM Script Gateway

A Revit addin for launching python scripts. The purpose of this small app is to fastly run and test Python scripts, rather than prototyping a full application. If you are tired about opening Dynamo for creating a Python node to test som API features, this is your addin. Otherwise, it would be better to use *PyRevit* or *RevitPythonShell*.

The main advantage of BIM Script Gateway is that it is using your local Python installation and it only executes Python scripts. You are absolutely freely to use your favorite IDE to edit Python scripts. Furthermore, the Revit API stubs are distributed with this project, so you can reference them to your linting tool.
